Program to view and search Employee, Inventory, and Invoice databases.

Just a quick program to familiarize myself with C#.NET Development.

Currently working on:

Inventory page Functionality

TO WORK ON:

Employee GUI Functionality

Invoice GUI + Functionality

(I use global variables... I know it's bad. I'll make changes once I finish the entire thing)
